- `MessageSendingFlags`: added `RPC` value.
- `TcpTransport`: added a disposable bits.
- `MTProtoConnection`: `Dispose()` method now calls `Dispose()` of an underlying transport.

#### SharpMTProto v0.5.1

- Changed target framework .NET 4.5 <- 4.5.1.

#### SharpMTProto v0.5

- Added `MTProtoBuilder`. It allows easily building of `IMTProtoConnection` and `IAuthKeyNegotiator`.

- Added `HashServices` for PCL.

#### SharpMTProto v0.4.3

- Updated ref to SharpTL v0.7.2.

- Added test for `MTProtoConnectionFactory`.

#### SharpMTProto v0.4.2

- Updated NuGet package dependencies to correspond project dependencies.

#### SharpMTProto v0.4.1

- Fix `MessageSerializer` bug. The problem was in wrong `TLStreamer` position retained after writing of the body length before the body, hence position left on a serialized message body beginning, but must be at the end.
- Fix `Message.Equals()` bug with bad `Body` comparing.
- Replace dependency type with interface. `FirstRequestResponseHandler`: replace dependency type (`RequestsManager`) with interface (`IRequestsManager`).

#### SharpMTProto v0.4

- Updated `BadMsgNotificationHandler` (refactoring). Updated debug message and added throwing of `NotImplementedException` on every unhandled error code.
- Updated completed task returning from Nito.AsyncEx.
- Updated dependent packages.
- Implemented `RPC` in `MTProtoConnection`.
- Huge refactoring (thanks to [Frank Ebersoll](https://github.com/frankebersoll) for ideas).

- Renamed `MessageCodec` methods: `Wrap()`/`Unwrap()` to `Encode()`/`Decode()`.
- Added `RandomGenerator`.
- Updated build script.
- Added `SendEncryptedMessage<TResponse>()` mthod to the `IMTProtoConnection`.
- `MTProtoConnection`: `SendMessage`'s `TResponse` now can be value type too.

#### SharpMTProto v0.3.1

- Added computation of an initial salt in `AuthKeyNegotiator`.
- Added serializers preparation into `MTProtoConnection`.

#### SharpMTProto v0.3

- Change log messages format for hex strings.

#### SharpMTProto v0.2.1

- Implemented correct RSA encryption.
- Added a couple of checks and default timeouts to the `MTProtoConnection`.
- Fixed transport bugs.
